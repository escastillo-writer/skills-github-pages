A refinement of the steps that were needed to make this post, based on some steps I skipped in the first post.
1. Name the file in the repository; _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md. Separate each new word in the title with a hypen.
2. Compose Front matter, consisting of the blog post's title in quotations and the date wrapped in three hyphens above and below.
3. Begin writing the blog post.
4. Preview the post.
5. Commit changes.
6. Pull request.
7. Merge changes.
